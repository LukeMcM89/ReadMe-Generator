# ReadMe Generator 

Upon downloaded the necessary dependencies (inquirer, package.json, package-lock.json) and opening an integrated terminal under the index.js file path, a user can start to create a template ReadMe by entering node index.js the command into the console terminal. 

Upon answering prompts and selecting a license, the user has a ReadMe format built-out with their specified input.
